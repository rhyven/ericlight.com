If I hold a 1-metre ruler out flat in front of me, and sprint forwards as fast as I can, Newton says that the ruler is still a metre long.  And to me, travelling at the same speed as the ruler, he would be right.  But to a stationary observer, the speed difference actually changes *their* perception of my ruler's length!  Normally we live at speeds way too slow to observe these effects - Usain Bolt's sprint speed would have the ruler still measuring 0.999999999999999394 metres long.  Even in the Lockheed SR-71 jet, travelling at a whopping kilometre per second, the ruler would still be 0.99999999999443675 metres long to a stationary observer.  But when we start approaching the speed of light, the effect gets very visible indeed: at 259,627km/s, while the ruler would still look a metre long to me, anyone observing would see a ruler that was only half a metre long!
