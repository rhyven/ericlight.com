When I was considering writing my post on time dilation, I expected precisely zero feedback... on the basis that probably nobody would read it.  I'm really pleased with the feedback I actually got, and you've all spurred me to write another post on the topic.  So today, I'm going to give you a brief glimpse into what caused all this ruckus:  Einstein's general theory of relativity.

If you remember, Einstein first came up with the special theory of relativity in 1905, and it took another ten years to get to the general theory of relativity.  This alone should show you that the jump from the special theory to the general theory was a major leap - but let's step back and see what this is all about.

Our very good childhood friend, Isaac Newton, published his _Prinicpia_ in **SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN**, which is... like... aaaaages ago.  With this, he laid the foundation of "classical mechanics", which are the physical concepts and mathematical methods that describe the motion of objects under the influence of various forces.

Classical mechanics worked well - *really* well.  There were tweaks here and there there over the ~*centuries*~, but by-and-large, classical (or "Newtonian") physics had things pretty much nailed... That is, until we started thinking about things that were really big, really small, or really fast... at that point, classical mechanics just kinda frayed at the edges.  

One of the most well-known places where classical mechanics falls down is the "precession of the perihelion of Mercury".  Don't worry what those words mean; basically, Mercury's orbit didn't behave the way that classical mechanics said it should.  The effect is suuuuper tiny: classical mechanics says that Mercury's orbit should change by 5557 arc-seconds per century, but in reality it changes by 5600 arc-seconds per century... a difference of 43 arcseconds.

How big is 43 arcseconds?  Stand at the lights on the corner of Gallagher drive, and look all the way down Gallagher drive as far as you can see.  Imagine a soccer ball on the ground, at the far end of the road.  *That's* bigger than the 43 arc-second discrepancy.  

I'm just gonna say that again in case you missed it, that was **per century**.  Less than a one-kilometre-away-soccer-ball every hundred years.  Yikes.
