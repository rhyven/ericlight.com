Title: Kate Bush - Army Dreamers guitar tab

Some friends and I have been working on our own version of [Army Dreamers, by Kate Bush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOZDKlpybZE).  The original version is replete with instruments, including a prominent Mandolin, some background violins, a synth of some sort, and even the sound of a rifle being racked.  Since we're two guitarists, a bassist, and a singer, there's _quite a bit_ of arranging to do to make it work.

Although there's plenty of tab around for the _mandolin_ part, that's only a few notes, with the violin part kicking in immediately afterwards.  I wanted to cover both.

There are four separate phases in it, which I've made up some unimaginative names for:

 - The slide phrase
 - The downwards walk
 - The upwards walk
 - The violin phrase

The bar structure runs like this:

1. Slide phrase + violin phrase
1. Downwards walk + violin phrase
1. Slide phrase + violin phrase
1. Upwards walk + violin phrase

That structure is then repeated for the entire song.  As you can see, the violin phrase is actually dominant, being played at the end of every bar.
