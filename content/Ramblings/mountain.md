![Landscape photography of Mount Tongariro and Mount Ngauruhoe, covered in white snow]({static}/images/tongariro.jpg)

I got a tattoo a couple years ago, which is a sketch outline of Mount Tongariro and Mount Ngauruhoe, in the Central Plateau of New Zealand.

The photo that the tattoo, which the tattoo was based on, was just the result of a Google search.  I've tried to find it many times since I actually got the tattoo - at very least just so I could give credit to the photographer.  However, to no avail.

The other day I happily found a copy of the photo, and went to Google's Reverse Image Search to figure out where it had come from!  The answer is...

... nowhere.  Whoever posted the image way-back-when appears to have taken the photo down.  The Mighty Goog can't find it anywhere.

So, here we are I guess.  I'm uploading the photo here so I don't lose it again.  If you took this photo, or if you know who did, please contact me!
