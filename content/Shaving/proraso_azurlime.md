Gather around, children, and I'll regale you with a tale of tonight's shaving.

My go-to razor setup at the moment is my [Edwin Jagger DE89](https://fineshave.co.nz/products/edwin-jagger-de89-safety-razor-with-barley-handle), with [Derby Extra](https://fineshave.co.nz/products/blades-50x-derby-de-razor-blades) blades. But that's not new.

You might remember that my favourite aftershave is American Crew's "[Post Shave Cooling Lotion](https://shop.americancrew.com/post-shave-cooling-lotion)". I've been using this almost exclusively for about 5 years now, and I love it. It's wonderfully soothing, and it's a fairly thin balm so it's easy to avoid overly-thick application. It's also not as thin as a milk (such as "[The Standard](https://www.thegr.com/shop-2/after-shave-balm/the-standard-after-shave-balm-all-natural-and-organic/)", by The Gentlemen's Refinery), which has a tendency to run through your fingers on the way to your face, not entirely unlike... milk.

Unfortunately American Crew's aftershave can be really difficult to find. So I popped a question to the team at [FineShave](https://fineshave.co.nz), and Frank gave me some insight into what he uses. This spurred me to try the [Proraso Aftershave line](https://fineshave.co.nz/collections/aftershave/proraso), and today I took delivery of a bottle of [Azur Lime](https://fineshave.co.nz/collections/aftershave/products/proraso-after-shave-balm-azur-lime-100ml).

This is a really, really nice aftershave. Again, it's a balm (I don't have any splash-type aftershaves yet). It's a little thicker than the American Crew that I'm used to, but still not thick.

WOW does it cover a lot of distance. I used three, maybe four drops worth and it covered my whole face. This 100ml bottle is going to last forever, but it's still a bit pricey at $35, which makes me give it a 6/10 on the price scale.

It's a light citrusy scent, with a little bit of mint, and a slightly musky underbelly. It smells nice, but the scent wears off fairly quickly, so probably a 7/10 for scent.

I also happened to give myself a spectacularly awful shave, which this aftershave has completely addressed - no discomfort or 'hot areas', and only a little redness in the mirror. I think that's a 10/10 for effectiveness.

All in all, this is a serious contender for my new favourite, and I expect I'll buy another bottle when it's done!  Recommended.
