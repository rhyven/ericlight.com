Inkbird were having a special in November, so I got a sous vide for Christmas!  There are heaps of places with recipes for the best sous vide eggs, most notably the always-outstanding [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2013/10/sous-vide-101-all-about-eggs.html), but also an excellent write-up on [Salt Pepper Skillet](https://saltpepperskillet.com/recipes/sous-vide-poached-eggs/), and of course sous vide manufacturer [Anova Culinary](https://anovaculinary.com/quick-guide-to-cooking-sous-vide-eggs-with-anova/) with a somewhat briefer post.

I submit to you that _none of these_ are the best sous vide eggs.  In my eyes, the best egg has a completely opaque white (not rubbery and not snot), with a semicooked gooey yolk like a cross between honey and custard.  Like this one:

The closest recipe on the pages I cited is the 13.5 minute egg at 75°C.  This is really close, but I found the yolk was a bit overcooked, and the white undercooked.  Absolute conundrum.

My fix?  A slightly hotter temperature, and take your eggs straight outta the fridge.  I found 76°C (169°F) for the vaunted 13.5 minutes managed to get the outer white to a non-snot texture, while the pre-chilledness of the egg kept the yolk from overcooking.
