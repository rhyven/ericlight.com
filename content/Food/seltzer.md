I got into brewing seltzer during the spring of 2021. Here are my notes.

# Highlights:

* Kveik Voss is fast-fermenting and very transparent flavour. Excellent for seltzer
* Recycling yeast is tricky with seltzer due to all the fruit flesh sediment. Still works, though
* With Dextrose as the main sugar, yeast nutrient is essential - about 15 grams
* Lychee have quite a prominent character, good to pair with something that can compete
* Mandarins impart very little flavour
* Jackfruit is almost undetectable, even with two cans; try blending next time
* One kg of dextrose in 19 litres will raise the ABV by approximately 2.65%
* Don't boil the fruit or you'll get pectin haze

# Recipes and notes

### Brew #4, 2021-12-12 - (soon): Black Doris Plum and Pineapple Seltzer

Recipe:

* 2kg Dextrose
* Kveik Voss yeast
* 12g yeast nutrient
* 850g tinned Black Doris plums
* 850g tinned pineapple (half crushed; half chunks)

Notes:
Brewing now, we'll see how it goes...
Initial tasting is very much drier than the others - not sure if this was the acids in the pineapple cutting the sugar, or if the sugar syrup in the cans was way thinner? Either way, this may end up a low percentage.
Original brix reading looked to be about 7%, suggesting an expected ABV of only 3.6%

### Brew #3, 2021-12-04 - 2021-12-10: Lychee and Jackfruit Seltzer

Recipe:

* 1.2kg Dextrose, plus other assorted sugars to 2kg (approx 5.3%)
* Kveik Voss yeast
* 16g yeast nutrient
* 850g tinned jackfruit
* 560g tinned lychee

Notes:

* Brewing out much quicker now with the increased nutrient
* Lychee is very prominent in finished product. Not overwhelming but definitely star of the show
* Jackfruit brings very little flavour. Next time I might blend it up but worried about post-brew yeast collection


### Brew #3, 2021-11-26 - 2021-12-03: Double Raspberry and Mandarin Seltzer

Recipe:

* 2kg Dextrose (for approx 5.3%)
* Kveik Voss yeast
* 16g yeast nutrient
* 820g tinned raspberries
* 310g tinned mandarins

Notes:

* Doubled the raspberry; reduced the dextrose; tripled the yeast nutrient
* Raspberry far more prominent and yum. Zero impact from mandarin
* Yeast nutrient really helped. Still a bit sweet but far better; probably no need to change
* Adding the dextrose, plus approximate sugar syrup and fruit sugars, suggests a 6% ABV


### Brew #2, 2021-11-17 to 2021-11-24: Raspberry and Mandarin Seltzer

Recipe:

* 2.5kg Dextrose (for approx 6%)
* Kveik Voss yeast
* 5g yeast nutrient
* 410g tinned raspberries
* 310g tinned mandarins

Method:

* Filled keg to 12l line with tap water
* 2.5kg Dextrose + 6g nutrient into 3 litres of water. Heated to 80째
* Took off heat, added tin of raspberries and tin of mandarins, including syrup; mashed up a bit
* Brought temp back up to 75째, and poured it into 16 litres of room temp water
* Pitched Kveik yeast at 29째. Total 20 litres ish, fermenting at 32째

Notes:

* Brew finished on 2021-11-24, exactly a week later
* Kveik ferments much quicker, and very clean; happy
* Mandarin very subtle, raspberry present but light. Still delicious
* Didn't add enough yeast nutrient!! Extremely sweet, but yeast has gone mostly dormant
* Forgot to account for sugars from fruits; happy the yeast went to sleep before I got rocket fuel


### Brew #1, 2021-10-25 to 2021-11-12: [Mangrove Jack's Pineapple Sunset Hard Seltzer](https://mangrovejacks.com/products/pineapple-sunset-hard-seltzer)

Brewed as per instructions, but added 12g of [Mangrove Jack's Passionfruit](https://mangrovejacks.com/collections/consumables/products/natural-beer-flavour-boost-passionfruit) Beer flavour boost.
Fermented a little slow; took a bit over two weeks to finish
Tasting notes: Came out with the same acrid/chemical flavour that many others complain about
Brewing process super simple, though. Think I can do this myself without a kit
