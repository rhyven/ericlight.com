I know this post is only going to be relevant for a couple of weeks, but today I tried to launch StarCraft Remastered under WINE and it crashed.

Pertinent info:
StarCraft Version 1.23.2.6926
WINE version 4.20-staging
Battle.Net version 1.18.0.11698

Fix was to open the Battle.Net settings -> Game Settings -> "Launch 32-bit client (instead of 64-bit)"

Apparently the 64-bit version has become the default sometime since I last played it (October?!): https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/starcraft/t/enabling-64-bit/458/7
