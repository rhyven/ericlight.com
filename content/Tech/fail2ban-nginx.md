After hosting a [mail server](https://www.iredmail.org) for a few years, I've gotten tired of seeing alllll the 404 attempts in my daily logwatch.  Fail2Ban can help here really well, and it turns out to be really easy.

Start with `nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-4xx.conf` (I'm counting on your running Debian and having things in default locations here), and enter the following:

```
[Definition]
failregex = ^<HOST>.*"(GET|POST).*" (404|444|403|400) .*$
ignoreregex =
```

*Note:  Make sure you use a capital 'D' in Definition there.*

Now, edit your /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf, and add these lines:
```
[nginx-4xx]
enabled = true
port = http,https
logpath = /var/log/nginx/access.log
maxretry = 3
```

Of course, modify your maxretry as desired.  Refresh your Fail2Ban rules with `service fail2ban restart`, and it should now be on the lookout for repeated 4xx errors.

You can confirm it's working with:  `fail2ban-client status nginx-4xx`:


```text
Status for the jail: nginx-4xx
|- Filter
|  |- Currently failed:	2
|  |- Total failed:	9
|  `- File list:	/var/log/nginx/access.log
`- Actions
   |- Currently banned:	2
   |- Total banned:	2
   `- Banned IP list:   123.232.123.101 123.232.123.102
```

_Success!_


Worth mentioning... for the first while I thought it wasn't working, but I realised I was trying to trigger the rule from on the same LAN, and ...

```
[DEFAULT]
# time is in seconds. 3600 = 1 hour, 86400 = 24 hours (1 day)
findtime    = 3600
bantime     = 3600
maxretry    = 5
ignoreip    = 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16
```

... I was hitting it from within the ignoreip range.  ðŸ˜¬

And of course, I can't finish off a blog without giving credit where it's due.  I got this all from GitHub user AysadKozanoglu, here: <https://gist.github.com/AysadKozanoglu/1335735272fb3b00a03bd3eea22af818>
