Woo!  [FreeNAS](https://www.freenas.org) finally supports ECC crypto for it's SSL certificates in 11.3!

I [reported this as a bug](https://redmine.ixsystems.com/issues/27665) almost exactly two years ago, and kept having to do nasty workarounds to make it work every time I installed an update.  Very happy that it's finally sorted and I can use my proper shiny elliptic curve SSL setup! :)
